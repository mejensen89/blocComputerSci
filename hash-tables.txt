>What is a hash table?

A:  A data structure that stores each value by linking it to a unique key, forming a key-value pair. 

>What is hashing?

A: The conversion of a string to a numerical index. 

>How does a hash table store data?

As key-value pairs in an internal array. The step by step is: 1) Take the key 2) Convert key to a Hash Code via a Hashing Function 3) Mod the Hash Code to get an Array Index 4) Store the value at the Array Index. 

>How are hash tables and objects different?

A: Hash tables are intended to store data of similar nature. Objects can store data of any type. 

>Determine whether you would use a hash table or an object to store each of the following pieces of data:

A list of pets and their unique names - Hash Table
The name, age, and the birthday of your best friend. Object
The name and location of every company in a given city.- Hash Table
All of the books checked out from a library by a particular individual. - Hast Table
The primary and secondary phone numbers for a contact. - Object

>Build a system that allows a sales associate to enter a customer's name, address, and phone number into the system and look up customers using their phone numbers. Store this information in a hash table.

```
class Customer {
	constructor(name, phoneNumber, address){
		this.name = name;
		this.phoneNumber = phoneNumber;
		this.address = address;
		this.list = []
	}
	set(name, phoneNumber, address) {
	this.list[phoneNumber] = [name, phoneNumber, address];
	}
	get(phoneNumber){
		return this.list[phoneNumber]
	}
}
```

>Build a system that allows a store owner to track their store's inventory using a hash table for storage.

```
let hash = require('string-hash')
class InventoryTrack{
	constructor(item, quantity) {
		this.item = item;
		this.quantitty = quantity;
		this.list = [];
	}
	set(item, quantity) {
		this.list[hash(item)] = [item, quantity];
	}
	get(item) {
		return this.list[hash(item)]
	}
}

let delivery = new InventoryTrack()
delivery.set('Mangos', 40)
delivery.set('cabbages', 31)
console.log(deliver.get('cabbages'));
```

>Build a system that allows digital copies of newspapers to be entered and searched by publisher and publication date. Use hash tables to store the necessary data.'


```
let hash = require('string-hash')
class DigiPaper{
  constructor(publisher, publicationDate) {
    this.publisher = publisher;
    this.publicationDate = publicationDate;
    this.list = []
  }
  set(publisher, publicationDate) {
    this.list[hash(publicationDate)] = [publisher, publicationDate];
    this.list[hash(publisher)] = [publisher, publicationDate]
  }
  get(publisherOrDate) {
    return this.list[hash(publisherOrDate)]
  }
}
let m = new DigiPaper()
m.set('USA TODAY', 'Dec 14, 1999')
m.set('HOUSTON CHRONICLE', 'Dec 25, 1999')
m.set('Charlotte News', 'Dec 14, 2015')

console.log(m.get('USA TODAY'))
console.log(m.get('Dec 14, 1999'))
console.log(m.get('Dec 14, 2015'))
```
