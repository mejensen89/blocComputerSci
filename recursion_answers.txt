>Define and compare recursion and iteration.

A: Recursion is when you call a funciton within itself with parameters moving towards a base case. Iteration is when you call a loop while certain conditions exist.

>Name five algorithms that are commonly implemented by recursion.

A: binary search, merge sort, quick sort, factorial operations and the Fibonacci sequence

>When should you use recursion, and when should you avoid recursion? Give examples for each.

A:When an algorithm can be defined as a combination of sub-results starting with known cases, then a recursive solution makes the most sense. oops are great at running straight through a data set, algorithms requiring a pass over a collection works well as an iterative solution.

>Compare the recursive and iterative solutions to the three algorithms from the checkpoint (factorial, maximum, and fibonacci). What is similar, and what is different?

A: Both solutions have base cases to prevent infinit looping/recursion, which is checked first on the recursive versions. The iterative code for the Factorial and Maximium functions looks cleaner. 

>Given a multi-dimensional collection (such as an array) where the number of dimensions is unknown, write a recursive algorithm to count the number of items in the entire collection.

```
function countEntries(collection) {
	if (collection.length === null || collection.length === 0){
	return "That's not a collection";
	} else {
		let total = 0;
		for ( var i = 0; i<collection.length; i++) {
			if(Array.isArray(collection[i])) {
				total += countEntries(collection[i]);
			} else{
				total ++
			}
		}
        console.log(total);
		return total;
	}
};
```

>A palindrome is a word or phrase whose spelling is the same either direction (e.g., racecar). Write a recursive algorithm to determine if a given word or phrase is a palindrome.

```
 function isPalindrome (str) {
    var strLen = str.length;
    if (strLen === 0 || strLen === 1) {
        return true;
    }
    
    if (str[0] === str[strLen - 1]) {
        return isPalindrome( str.slice(1, strLen - 1) );
    }
    
    return false;
};

```



>Google Easter Egg: Google the term "recursion". Google will prompt you with "Did you mean: recursion". Explain why this behavior exhibits properties of recursion.

A: Because it allows you to repeat the search within the search, which doing the same thing again and that is the definition of recursion.
